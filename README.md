# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
Traffic Sign Recognition and detection using GTSRB and GTSDB datasets

Traffic sign Detection and Recogition is a crucial task in the Autonomous driving
and ADAS Applications. Lot of work is being done in this field nowadays. There
are various Datasets available for this task like the German Traffic Sign Recognition
Benchmark (GTSRB), the German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB),
LISA Traffic Sign Dataset which contains the US Traffic Signs, KUL BelgiumTS
Dataset and the Swedish Traffic Sign dataset (STS). For this Project, we used the
GTSRB and GTSDB Datasets. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the
Recognition and Detection models. The Evaluations were done seperately for Detec-
tion and Recognition, as well as both combined.
